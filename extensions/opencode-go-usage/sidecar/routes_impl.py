"""Route implementations for the opencode-go-usage sidecar (token-v1 scaffold).

Every route here runs behind the scaffold's deny-by-default token guard
(``sidecar_base.py``); ``/health`` (scaffold-owned) is the only tokenless route.
The work lives in ``opencode_usage.py`` — this file only maps HTTP routes onto it
and shapes the JSON response.

Both routes are read-only: they read the API key (env or ``~/.hermes/.env``) to make
one outbound GET for the Go plan windows. Nothing here mutates state, so the only
verb is GET. The outbound call is capped at 6 s and refuses redirects, comfortably
inside the proxy's ~10 s buffered upstream timeout, so no start-job/poll dance is
needed.
